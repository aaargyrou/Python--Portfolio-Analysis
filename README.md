# portfolio-analysis-homework
In this assignment I created an analysis notebook that analyses and visualises the major matrics of the portfolios and determine which portfoliuo outperformed the others. The portfolios I analyse are historical data from algorithmic portfolios, some that represent portfolios of famous "whale" investors like Warren Buffet, and some from the big hedge and mutual funds. 

I then created a custom portfolio, Apple, Microsoft and Square, and compare its performance to the other portfolios and the S&P TSX 60 market index.

## Main Tasks
I used pyton to:
1. Read in and Wrangle Returns Data
2. Determine the Success of Each Portoflio
3. Choose and Evaluate a Custom Portfolio
